##If/Then/Either
 - Start
 - you find yourself on a boat in the middle of lake erie
 - the only things that you find in the the boat are two oars and a worn backpack
 
Either
you can open the backpack
you can sit and wait for death
you can attempt to drown yourself

If you sit and wait for death - you instantly die
If you attempt to drown yourself - you instantly die
If you open the backpack - you find a flachlight, a pocketknife, a bottle of water, a granola bar, and a note titled instuctions

Either
open note titled instructions
turn on flashlight
stab yourself in the heart with the pocketknife
sit and wait for death
attempt to drown yourself
drink your bottle of water
eat your granola bar
put everything back into the backpack

If you open note titled instructions - you see instructions
If you turn on your flash light on - you will waste the battery, so you will die overnight without it
If you stab yourself in the heart with the pocketknife - you instantly die
If you sit and wait for death - you instantly die
If you attempt to drown yourself - you instantly die
If you drink your bottle of water -  this is your only water, so you die of dehydration, therefore you instantly die
If you eat your granola bar - you instantly die of lack of nutrition
If you put everything pack into the backpack - you won't know what to do so you instantly die

Either - (you have now seen the instructions)
try to kill yourself in some way
use oars to go north - which is where you see a walleye that you might be able to catch with your hands
use oars to go east - which is where you see virtually nothing
use oars to go south - there seems to be land that way, all the way in the distancel
use oars to go west - there is just a peice of sharp driftwood floating around




The rest is in outline form on the notebook.
